## Briefly about the CRM
The CRM consist with 3 presentation FrontEnd. One for attenders, another one for back-officers and the last for admins. All of them consumes the SimpleCRM.WebAPI.

### 1 - Attendant (React.js)
The attendant can register new customers and make interactions with them. Update the customer data and
try to sell products for them.
The user can "rework" an interaction when is requested by the backoffice

### 2 - Backoffice (Razor)
The backoffice will validate the attendant's sale, approving it or send back to the attendant with some observation.

### 3 - Control Panel (Angular)
The control panel is for admin. This will have a dashboard, report section and administration tools, like User and Product administration (CRUD).
